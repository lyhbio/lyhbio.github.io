  <p>Lab Introduction</p>
</div>

We are affiliated with the Department of Bioinformatics at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, committed to addressing key challenges in life sciences and drug development through interdisciplinary integration.

In the post-genomic era, biomedical data is growing at an exponential rate. The core philosophy of our research group is "data-driven scientific discovery." We closely integrate cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms with high-throughput single-cell multi-omics technologies to construct a comprehensive research framework, ranging from microscopic cell atlases to macroscopic drug networks.

Currently, our research group focuses on the following three interrelated directions:

1. **Artificial Intelligence and Drug Discovery**: Utilizing advanced AI technologies such as deep learning and large language models, we aim to construct drug-target interaction models to accelerate the screening and optimization of lead compounds, thereby reducing the cost and time required for new drug development.

2. **Single-Cell Multi-Omics Algorithms and Applications**: We develop and apply the latest bioinformatics tools to analyze cellular heterogeneity in complex diseases, such as cancers and immune disorders, at the single-cell level, with the goal of uncovering potential drug targets.

3. **Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine**: By applying systems biology and modern omics technologies, we investigate the active ingredients and mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine (especially authentic medicinal materials), translating traditional medical wisdom into scientific language, and promoting the internationalization and modernization of Chinese medicine.

We warmly welcome students interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, and drug design to join us in exploring the mysteries of life data.
