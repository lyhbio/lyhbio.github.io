  <p>Lab Introduction</p>
</div>

Our research group focuses on bioinformaticsâ€”an interdisciplinary field that merges biology, computer science, and information science to analyze and interpret complex biological data. We develop and apply computational methods, algorithms, and software tools to uncover biological insights, explore large-scale datasets, and model living systems.

Bioinformatics underpins a wide range of modern life science research, from genomics and proteomics to structural biology, evolutionary studies, and systems biology. Our work involves advanced computational techniques like machine learning and deep learning to integrate multi-source biological data for predicting drug-target interactions, optimizing drug design, and accelerating new drug development. We also construct and manage comprehensive biomedical databases, integrating large-scale data from genomics, proteomics, and more. Additionally, we analyze gene expression profiles, build cell-type-specific networks, and study the dynamics of genetic variations at the single-cell level.
