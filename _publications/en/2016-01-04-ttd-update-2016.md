To facilitate drug discovery, it is essential to have access to comprehensive information on drugs, their targets, and the pathways they modulate. This paper describes a significant update to the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). The 2016 version features a substantial increase in the coverage of clinical trial targets and drugs, which are now 1.6 and 2.3 times greater than the previous release, respectively. A major enhancement is the cross-linking of TTD target and drug entries to multiple pathway databases, including KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways, providing a richer context for drug-target interactions. This update solidifies TTD's role as a valuable resource for drug discovery and systems pharmacology research.
