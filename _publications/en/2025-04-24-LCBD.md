To address the issue of fragmented biomarker data across numerous publications, we have developed the Lung Cancer Biomarker Database (LCBD), available at [http://lcbd.biomarkerdb.com](http://lcbd.biomarkerdb.com). We comprehensively reviewed and extracted biomarker information from studies up to June 30, 2023. After curation, we collected 1,447 unique biomarkers, which were systematically annotated. The validity of the biomarkers was confirmed using prognostic, diagnostic, and immune infiltration models. The LCBD provides a valuable and centralized resource for lung cancer research and therapeutic strategies.
