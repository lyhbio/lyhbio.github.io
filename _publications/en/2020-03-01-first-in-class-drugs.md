Analysis of clinical trial timelines can reveal features that facilitate target assessment. We performed a comprehensive analysis of 89 innovative targets from first-in-class drugs approved between 2004-2017. Our study confirmed known druggability characteristics and, more importantly, exposed trial-speed differentiating features related to on-target and off-target effects. We derived a simple rule that correctly identified 75% of "speedy" human targets (those progressing from Phase I to approval within 8 years), which can help prioritize future drug discovery and development efforts.
