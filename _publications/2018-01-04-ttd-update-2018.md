Convenient access to comprehensive data on therapeutic targets is crucial for drug discovery. This paper details a significant update to the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD). The 2018 version includes new information on: drug resistance mutations, differential expression profiles of targets in patient tissues, expression profiles in healthy tissues, and target combinations. This enrichment makes TTD a more powerful resource for facilitating patient-focused research, discovery, and clinical investigation of targeted therapeutics.
