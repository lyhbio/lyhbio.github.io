The human kinome is a highly productive class of drug targets. With an emerging need for polypharmacology to treat complex diseases, we conducted a comparative analysis of FDA-approved multi-target drugs and combination products targeting the kinome. Using a network medicine approach, we found that multi-target drugs tend to inhibit closely related target pairs (e.g., in the receptor tyrosine kinase family), while combination products are effective against targets with more distant homology. This analysis helps identify novel target pairs and informs strategies for developing next-generation polypharmacology.
