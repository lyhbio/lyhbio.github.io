To address shortcomings in data quality and coverage for neurological and psychiatric disorders (NPDs), we developed the DTNPD database, available at [http://dtnpd.cnsdrug.com](http://dtnpd.cnsdrug.com). The database contains detailed information on 30 NPD types, 1,847 drugs, 514 targets, and their associations. A key strength of DTNPD is its robust network of drug and target combinations, facilitating network pharmacology studies and advancing research in the field of NPDs.
