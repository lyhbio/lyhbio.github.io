Predicting protein function is critical for biological and medical research. Our SVM-Prot web-server uses a machine learning approach to predict protein functional families from sequences, which is particularly useful for distantly-related proteins or homologous proteins with different functions. Since its initial release, we have made significant improvements, including: expanding coverage from 54 to 192 functional families, incorporating more diverse protein descriptors, improving predictive performance, and adding BLAST analysis and batch submission options. The server now also includes K-nearest neighbor and probabilistic neural network methods to facilitate a collective assessment of protein function.
