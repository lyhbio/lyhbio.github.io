### Abstract

Drug repurposing offers a promising alternative to traditional drug development by identifying new therapeutic uses for existing drugs, which significantly reduces cost and time. However, current methods often rely on limited data sources and simplistic assumptions, restricting their ability to capture the multifaceted nature of biological systems. This study introduces a novel adaptive multi-view learning (AMVL) method that integrates chemical-induced transcriptional profiles (CTPs), knowledge graph (KG) embeddings, and large language model (LLM) representations to enhance the predictive power of drug repurposing.

### Highlights

*   AMVL improves drug repurposing efficacy by leveraging multi-source similarities within a heterogeneous network.
*   This study is the first to integrate chemical-induced transcriptional profiles, knowledge graph embeddings, and large language model representations for this purpose.
*   On three benchmark datasets and one validation set, AMVL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, including AUC, AUPR, and F1.
