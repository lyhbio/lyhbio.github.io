This course is designed for students who already have a basic knowledge of Python, aiming to enhance their programming skills and efficiency in solving complex problems. The course focuses on:
*   Advanced Python features, such as decorators, generators, and metaclasses
*   In-depth application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   Concurrent programming (multithreading, multiprocessing, asynchronous I/O)
*   Advanced usage of scientific computing and data analysis libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
*   Code optimization and performance analysis

Through this course, students will be able to write more efficient, standardized, and scalable Python code to meet the data-intensive challenges in the field of bioinformatics.
